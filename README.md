## Overview
In this day and age, there are millions of applications that have been created and are widely used. A developer’s ability to read and understand code is even more important than their ability to write code. As such, you will be given an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that will need to be enhanced and improved. 
As part of this project, you will be expected to understand architectural patterns as well as pay specific attention to implementing coding principles and design patterns
